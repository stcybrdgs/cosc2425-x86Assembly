#arduinoProject01

This project was a team effort to design a Theramin circuit that could be controlled by an Arduino controller using the C language. The circuit combines an LED array, a bank of photo-sensors, and a potentiometer to manipulate the data input, while a set of mini speakers is used to produce the Theramin-like audio output.   

The C code and the project documentation are all included in the .pdf report.
