#arduinoProject01

This project was built by a student team. We designed an original Theramin circuit that can be controlled by an Arduino controller using C++. 

The circuit combines an LED array, a bank of photo-sensors, a potentiometer, and a flex-sensor to manipulate the data input, while a set of mini speakers produces the Theramin-like audio output.   

The program code, the circuit diagram, and all project documentation are included in the .pdf report.
