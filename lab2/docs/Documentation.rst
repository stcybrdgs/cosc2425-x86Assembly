Description:    This project disposes requirements for COSC2425 Lab 2 and confirms the student can use the course tool set to 
                1.) edit an .asm file to produce specific text output; and 
                2.) use a Makefile to generate .o and .exe files for a project build.

                Based on an assembly-code file provided by the instructor, the student edited the code as needed
                to allow the following text to be sent to the console when printf is called at runtime:
                        Course: COSC2425 Lab2
                        Student: firstname lastname
                        Project: Nasm Hello World
