This project explore using x86 assembly language on a Teensy USB Controller board to control a timer. 

The project compiles code from three files:
- **[Main file](src/Main.s)**
- **[Timer file](src/Timer.s)**
- **[Config file](src/config.s)**

Normally, the Teensy board (and its big brother, the Arduino) is programmed using C, so this project provided a twist on how programmers might choose to program the board.
