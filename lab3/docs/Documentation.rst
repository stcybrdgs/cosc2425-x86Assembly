Description:    
This project disposes requirements for COSC2425 Lab 3.

This project includes eight files, which provide the C++ and NASM source code (one each) for four programs that explore assembly-language constructs for the following patterns:
	- print function
	- If Else loop
	- While loop (single loop) 
	- While loop (multi-loop controlled by a counter)

While researching the patterns necessary to complete this project, I worked with David Torrente and Steven Wyman, both of whom provided helpful insights based upon their more advanced understanding of the subject material.
