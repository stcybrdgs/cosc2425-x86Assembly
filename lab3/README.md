This project required translating thd code from four small C++ programs into x86 assembly language. The resulting x86 programs include:
- **[print function](src/hello_nasm.asm)**
- **[If-Else statement](src/ifElse_nasm.asm)**
- **[While loop](src/while_nasm.asm)**
- **[While loop controlled by a counter](src/countedWhile_nasm.asm)**
