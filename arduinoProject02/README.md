#arduinoProject02

This project was a team effort to use x86 to program an Arduino controller to read input from an infra-red sensor.

The circuit combined an LED array, a bank of photo-sensors, and a potentiometer to manipulate the data input, while a set of mini speakers was used to produce the Theramin-like audio output.   

The C code and the project documentation are all included in the .pdf report.
