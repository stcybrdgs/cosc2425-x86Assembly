Description:    
This project disposes requirements for COSC2425 Lab 4.

This project includes three files:
	- lab4.asm	(the raw NASM code for the lab4 specs)
	- lab4_script	(gdb debugging script)
	- Makefile	(the make file to build out the .o and .exe)

The NASM code loads an integer into RAX, increments it via RBX, and then prints out the original integer, the incremented integer, and three hard-coded text strings, all per the lab4 specification.
