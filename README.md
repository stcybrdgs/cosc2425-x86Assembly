# cosc2425-x86Assembly
This repo contains x86 assembly language program from college coursework.

- arduinoProject01: this team project used C to program Arduino to behave like a Theramin
- arduinoProject02: this team project used x86 to program Arduino to read an infrared sensor
- lab2: this project was my first assembly code to print some info about me to the console
- lab3: this project was an exercise in translating C++ code into x86 assembly language
- lab4: this project used RAX and RBX to operate on an integer and to print to the console
- lab6: this project used x86 to produce output sourced from multiple .asm files 
- lab8: this project used x86 to manipulate components on a Teensy USB Controller board
- lab9: this project was a more complex version of lab8 based on multiple x86 source docs
