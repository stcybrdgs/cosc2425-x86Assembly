# cosc2425-x86Assembly
This repo contains x86 assembly language program from college coursework.

- arduinoProject01: a team project using C++ to program Arduino to behave like a Theramin
- arduinoProject02: a team project using x86 to program Arduino to read an infrared sensor
- lab2: my first x86 program, which prints some info about me to the console
- lab3: an exercise in translating C++ code into x86 assembly language
- lab4: a project using RAX and RBX to operate on an integer and to print to the console
- lab6: a project using x86 to produce output sourced from multiple .asm files 
- lab8: a project using x86 to manipulate components on a Teensy USB Controller board
- lab9: a more complex version of lab8, based on multiple x86 source docs
